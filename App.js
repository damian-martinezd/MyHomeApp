        Before we jump into Electrode Native Navigation, itâ€™s essential to understand what Electrode Native is, and why we have created this framework. Electrode Native allows for the combination of multiple MiniApps (React Native applications) into a single container. The container is generated entirely by the Electrode Native platform and is packaged as an AAR library for Android and as a Framework for iOS (these libraries are similar to standard third-party libraries that Android and iOS developers are familiar with).
